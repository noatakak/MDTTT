                    Conductor’s Podium: VR will also enable students of conducting to connect with their instructors for real-time, 3D, instruction from anywhere in the world. 
                    This project is currently in progress and scheduled for completion and release in Summer 2024.</p>

                <p class="description">A twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe that makes the game more engaging to play and less likely to result in a tie. 
                    I designed a 3D game mode which is just what it sounds like, Tic-Tac-Toe but with a 3×3×3 cube, as well as a “Multi-Dimensional” game mode. 
                    Multi-Dimensional mode starts as a 3D game, but every time a cube is selected, a flat or “normal” game is initiated, whoever wins the normal game, claims the cube. 
                    I also introduced “Override Moves” which allow players to play on top of their opponent in the flat game, and further shake up the pattern of traditional Tic-Tac-Toe.</p>

                    I wanted to learn a bit about web development and using HTML, CSS, and JS.
                    This is the second iteration of this website. The first had a blue and white color theme, with a sliding navigation bar on the left side.
                    This new iteration doesn't have any moving parts, yet, but unlike the first one, I feel it is much more enjoyable to use and view, as well as being much better formatted for any aspect ratio of screen.

                <p class="about_text text_1">I was born in Kotzebue, Alaska, but spent most of my life growing up in Juneau, Alaska. In grade school I was incredibly focused on music and robotics. 
                    I play the viola and the violin and in my freshman year of high school, I was invited to join the Juneau Symphony Orchestra. 
                    Throughout my entire youth, I was involved with the FIRST robotics program. 
                    I started in the FIRST Lego League (FLL) program in 1st grade, and then in high school, I joined the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). 
                    In FTC, I was the captain of my team for three years, and in my third year as captain, my team became the Alaska State Champions. 
                    We then went on to compete at the World Championships for that season, it was the first time any team from Southeast Alaska had competed at that scale.</p>

                <p class="about_text">I currently attend Pacific Lutheran University (PLU) in Tacoma, Washington, and as of Fall 2022 I am in my fifth year of a double degree program. 
                    My two degrees are a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Music in Music Education. 
                    I expect to graduate in December of 2024 after I have completed my computer science course work, and my student-teaching for my music degree. 
                    <br><br>
                    I am incredibly passionate about working in video game development after I graduate. 
                    I see video games as the perfect combination of all art forms, which include a level of audience interaction/agency that is not possible in any other media. 
                    I love storytelling, and no medium can tell stories or create memorable experiences quite like what is possible with video games.

                    This year, I also organized a “long-form” game jam at my university to encourage people in all disciplines to learn about making games in a format that does not encourage crunch, but rather education and learning, as well as being able to build a final product that you can be proud of. 
                    This long-form game jam also includes monthly showcase meetings, talks/reviews from people currently working the the game development industry.</p>
