        <h1>Hello! My name is Noatak Post!</h1>
        <p>I was born in Kotzebue, Alaska, but spent most of my life growing up in Juneau, Alaska. In grade school I was incredibly focused on music and robotics. I play the viola and the violin
        and in my freshman year of high school, I was invited to join the Juneau Symphony Orchestra. Throughout my entire youth, I was involved with the FIRST robotics program. I started in the
        FIRST Lego League (FLL) program in 1st grade, and then in high school, I joined the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). In FTC, I was the captain of my team for three years, and in my third year as captain, my team became the
        Alaska State Champions. We then went on to compete at the World Championships for that season, the first time any team from Southeast Alaska had competed at that scale.</p>
        <p>I currently attend Pacific Lutheran University (PLU) in Tacoma, Washington, and I am currently in my fourth year of a double degree program. My two degrees are a
        Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Music in Music Education. I started school with my music degree, so as of now (October 2022) I am nearing the end of my required
        classes for my music degree, and I am just starting to dive head on into the world of computer science. I expect to graduate in December of 2024 after I have completed my computer science
        course work, and my music student-teaching.</p>
        <p>I am particularly passionate about working in the video game industry after I have finished school. I see video games as the ultimate cilmination of nearly all art forms, which also
        includes a level of interaction and engagement with its audience that no other form of art or entertainment is able to achieve. Being a musician, I am also especially interested in the
        way that music is used in games to convey a narrative and portray a world to the audience. Some of my biggest inspirations in terms of game design, narrative, and music include Journey (thatgamecompany), ABZU (Giant Squid),
        The Pathless (Giant Squid), The Beginner's Guide (Davey Wreden), Outer Wilds (Mobius Digital), Stardew Valley (ConcernedApe), Homeworld (Relic Entertainment), Subsurface Circular (Bithell Games), and No Man's Sky (Hello Games).</p>
        <p>In my free time I have a number of games that I am working on as personal projects. These projects include but are not limited to:<br>
        <h4>- Multi-Dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe</h4>
          An attempt to make the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe more engaging to play and more challenging to win. (Currently playable under the projects section of this website!)<br>
        <h4>- Jig</h4>
          A pixel-art fishing game where each fish you hook starts a Guitar Hero-style rhythm game that you must win to catch the fish. This is a project I am working on with a friend.<br>
        <h4>- Invader Evader</h4>
          An Oculus Quest 2 game where the player pilots a spaceship using the hand-tracking on the Quest 2 to avoid incoming asteroids and alien attackers in an endless-runner style loop.<br>
        <h4>- Conductor VR</h4>
          A potential direction for my Computer Science Senior Capstone project that incorporates the skills I have acquired from both my computer science and music degrees as well as knowledge and experience that will be gained
          making Jig and Invader Evader. Conductor VR is a virtual practice room for students to learn and practice the art of conducting a music ensemble. Inspired by the lack of access and
          accommodations available to conducting students during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Conductor VR aims to create a way for conducting teachers and students to engage each other in real time in a 3D environment
          from anywhere in the world. Thanks to the hand-tracking of the Quest 2, teachers and students will be able to view and critic conducting technique virtually.
          Additionally. it will offer practice tools to help conducting students improve the positioning and technique of their conducting through visual and audio assistance.</p>
