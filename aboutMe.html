      <h1>Hello! My name is Noatak Post!</h1>
      <p>I was born in Kotzebue, Alaska, but spent most of my life growing up in Juneau, Alaska. In grade school I was incredibly focused on music and robotics. I play the viola and the violin
      and in my freshmna year of high school I was invited to join the Juneau Symphony Orchestra. Throughout my entire youth I was involved with the FIRST robotics program. Originally through their
      FIRST Lego League (FLL) program, and then later the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). In FTC I was the captain of my team for three years, and in my third year as captain, my team became the
      Alaska State Champions. We then went on to compete at the World Championships for that season.</p>
      <p>In college, I have been attending Pacific Lutheran University (PLU) in Tacoma, Washington, where I am currently in my fourth year, working on completing a double degree program. My two degrees are a
      Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Muic in Music Education. I started school with my music degree, so as of now (October 2022) I am nearing the end of my required
      classes for my music degree, and I am just starting to dive head into the world of computer science. I expect to graduate in the December of 2024, after I have completed my computer science
      course work, and my music student-teaching.</p>
      <p>I am especially passionate about going to work in the video game industry after I have finished school. I see Video Games as the ultimate culmiation of nearly all art forms, which also
      include a level of interaction and engagement with it's audience that no other form of art or entertainment is able to achieve. Being a musician I am also espcially interested in the
      way that music is used in games to convey a narrative and portray a world to the audience. Some of my biggest inspirations in no particular order include Journey (thatgamecompany), ABZU (Giant Squid),
      The Beginner's Guide (), Outer Wilds (), Stardew Valley (), Homeworld ()</p>
